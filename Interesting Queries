Given an array nums of n elements and q queries . Each query consists of two integers l and r . You task is to find the number of elements of nums[] in range [l,r] which occur atleast k times.
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = {1,1,2,1,3}, Queries = {{1,5},
{2,4}}, k = 1
Output: {3,2}
Explanation: For the 1st query, from l=1 to r=5
1, 2 and 3 have the frequency atleast 1.
For the second query, from l=2 to r=4, 1 and 2 have 
the frequency atleast 1.



from collections import Counter

def findElementsWithFrequency(nums, queries, k):
    counter = Counter(nums)
    prefix_sum = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + (counter[num] >= k)
    
    results = []
    
    for query in queries:
        l, r = query
        result = prefix_sum[r] - prefix_sum[l - 1]
        results.append(result)
    
    return results

# Example
nums = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]
queries = [(1, 5), (2, 4)]
k = 1
output = findElementsWithFrequency(nums, queries, k)
print(output)  # Output: [3, 2]
